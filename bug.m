In Objective-C, a rare but impactful error stems from misuse of the `retain`, `release`, and `autorelease` methods within manual reference counting (MRC).  Specifically, an object might be prematurely released while still in use, leading to a crash. This is particularly tricky when dealing with complex object lifecycles and nested structures.  For example:

```objectivec
@interface MyClass : NSObject
@property (retain) NSString *someString;
@end

@implementation MyClass
- (void)someMethod {
    NSString *tempString = [[NSString alloc] initWithString: @"Hello"];
    self.someString = tempString; // tempString is now retained
    [tempString release]; // ERROR!  tempString is released, but self still owns it. 
}
@end
```

This code incorrectly releases `tempString` even though `self` now owns it due to the assignment to `self.someString`. The correct approach is to not release `tempString` after assigning to a property that manages its memory.
